# Assignment-Coding-for-Economists

MPA 1st year Reika Nishino
- I wrote the code while checking the class notes, materials used during the class, and Google searches.
- I used the data from this website: https://osf.io/3g7pd/

## Learning Outcomes to Demonstrate
1. Understand folder structure. Perform operations on files in different folders.
2. Automate repeating tasks using Python ‚Äúfor‚Äù loops.
3. Use Python ‚Äúlists‚Äù and ‚Äúdictionaries‚Äù appropriately. Demonstrate one of the two.
4. Break up work into smaller components using Stata .do files.
5. Read .csv data in. Fix common data quality errors (for example, string vs number, missing value). (in Stata and in Python as well)
