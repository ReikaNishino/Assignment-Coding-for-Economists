# Assignment-Coding-for-Economists

MPA 1st year Reika Nishino
- I wrote the code while checking the class notes, materials used during the class, and Google searches.
   - links are the ones that I referred
   - I also referred the websites we used during the lectures but I do not mention in this README file because it is gonna be too long if it includes all of them
- I used the data from this website: https://osf.io/3g7pd/

## Learning Outcomes to Demonstrate
1. Understand folder structure. Perform operations on files in different folders.
2. Automate repeating tasks using Python “for” loops.
3. Use Python “lists” and “dictionaries” appropriately. Demonstrate one of the two.
4. Break up work into smaller components using Stata .do files.
5. Read .csv data in. Fix common data quality errors (for example, string vs number, missing value). (in Stata and in Python as well)

11. Commit files into git version control.
12. Name files, functions and variables appropriately.
13. Write helpful comments and commit messages. Demonstrate both.
14. Push a repository to GitHub.
15. Explain how to reproduce your work with short instructions or a self-documenting master script.
